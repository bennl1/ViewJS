        <!------- Loading JS scripts ------->
        <!-- When loading JS scripts, considerations should be made regarding when
            the DOM is being loaded, and when different scripts 
            depend on each other. Below are examples of a few different ways to load the scripts.

        -->
        <!-- Load any CSS before the JS in case you need to access styles in your scripts. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style_example.css">
        <!-- 'defer' states that the script should be executed after the HTML is parsed.
            If multiple scripts have 'defer', they are loaded one after the other.  
            This will guarantee execution order, and ensure that scripts that depend on each other load
            in an order that will not cause errors. -->
        <!-- First we load jquery from a Google CDN (content delivery network). -->
        <script defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <!-- Then we load a script that depends on jQuery -->
        <script defer type="text/javascript" src='../js/view.js'></script>
        <!-- Then we load a script that depends on our libraries (and jQuery) -->
        <script defer type="text/javascript" src='../js/example.js'></script>


    </head>
<body>
    <div id = 'sidePanel'>
    </div>
    <div id="instruction_container">
        <p class = "instruction">
            Whether the panel is in horizontal or vertical format/layout, the user 
            is able to drag and drop each section inside the list to reorder them,
            to fulfill user's wish of the priority of each of the sections. To do it,
            simply drag the section name to the place of desire.
        </p>
        <p class = "instruction">
            This is useful in cases where the user does not like the current ordering
            of the sections from time to time, and this feature gives the user the
            option to rearrange.
        </p>
