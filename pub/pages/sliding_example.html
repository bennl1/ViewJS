        <!------- Loading JS scripts ------->
        <!-- When loading JS scripts, considerations should be made regarding when
            the DOM is being loaded, and when different scripts 
            depend on each other. Below are examples of a few different ways to load the scripts.

        -->
        <!-- Load any CSS before the JS in case you need to access styles in your scripts. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style_example.css">
        <!-- 'defer' states that the script should be executed after the HTML is parsed.
            If multiple scripts have 'defer', they are loaded one after the other.  
            This will guarantee execution order, and ensure that scripts that depend on each other load
            in an order that will not cause errors. -->
        <!-- First we load jquery from a Google CDN (content delivery network). -->
        <script defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <!-- Then we load a script that depends on jQuery -->
        <script defer type="text/javascript" src='../js/view.js'></script>
        <!-- Then we load a script that depends on our libraries (and jQuery) -->
        <script defer type="text/javascript" src='../js/example.js'></script>

<body>
    <div id = 'sidePanel'>
    </div>
    <div id="instruction_container">
        <p class = "instruction">
            First, click on the button on the top left. After the panel shows up, 
            click and drag the grey side bar to expand/shrink your side panel.
            At any time, you can also click the show/hide button to show or hide
            the panel.
        </p>
        <p class = "instruction">
            Hover on the grey side bar will also display the usage.
        </p>
        <p class = "instruction">
            This is very useful in cases where the user has a smaller screen or 
            just the wide panel blocks his/her view. Then, he/she can use this feature
            to adjust the width of the panel of his/her desire.
        </p>
