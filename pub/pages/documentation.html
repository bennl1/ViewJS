        <!------- Loading JS scripts ------->
        <!-- When loading JS scripts, considerations should be made regarding when
            the DOM is being loaded, and when different scripts 
            depend on each other. Below are examples of a few different ways to load the scripts.

        -->
        <!-- Load any CSS before the JS in case you need to access styles in your scripts. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style_doc.css">

        <!-- 'defer' states that the script should be executed after the HTML is parsed.
            If multiple scripts have 'defer', they are loaded one after the other.  
            This will guarantee execution order, and ensure that scripts that depend on each other load
            in an order that will not cause errors. -->
        <!-- First we load jquery from a Google CDN (content delivery network). -->
