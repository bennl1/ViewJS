        <!------- Loading JS scripts ------->
        <!-- When loading JS scripts, considerations should be made regarding when
            the DOM is being loaded, and when different scripts 
            depend on each other. Below are examples of a few different ways to load the scripts.

        -->
        <!-- Load any CSS before the JS in case you need to access styles in your scripts. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style_example.css">
        <!-- 'defer' states that the script should be executed after the HTML is parsed.
            If multiple scripts have 'defer', they are loaded one after the other.  
            This will guarantee execution order, and ensure that scripts that depend on each other load
            in an order that will not cause errors. -->
        <!-- First we load jquery from a Google CDN (content delivery network). -->
        <script defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <!-- Then we load a script that depends on jQuery -->
        <script defer type="text/javascript" src='../js/view.js'></script>
        <!-- Then we load a script that depends on our libraries (and jQuery) -->
        <script defer type="text/javascript" src='../js/example.js'></script>

<body>
    <div id = 'sidePanel'>
    </div>
    <div id="instruction_container">
        <p class = "instruction">
            This is where things gets interesting. Whether the side panel
            is showing or hidden, or in whatever width at its showing position,
            you can simply click the "SWAP" button on the bottom left to change
            it to a horizontal navigation type of format.
        </p>
        <p class = "instruction">
            Hover on the button will also display the usage.
        </p>
        <p class = "instruction">
            This is useful in cases where the user wants to change the 
            format/layout of the website, sometimes the website he/she is in might
            be better viewed with a horizontal panel, while sometimes it is better 
            to view in a side panel.
        </p>
        <img class = "instruction" src = "../img/swap.png" height="auto" width="850px"/>
